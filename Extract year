Q3:You have been asked to count the number of employees hired each year and save this value as Employees_count. The report should only consider employees who are currently employed (i.e., those holding current jobs).
The result should include the columns Year and Employees_count.
The result should be ordered -
by Employees_count in descending order to highlight the years with the highest hiring, and
by Year in ascending order to maintain chronological order within ties.

Ans:

SELECT 
    YEAR(hire_date) AS 'Year', 
    COUNT(employee_id) AS 'Employees_count'
FROM 
    employees
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(hire_date)
ORDER BY 
    Employees_count DESC, 
    Year ASC;
