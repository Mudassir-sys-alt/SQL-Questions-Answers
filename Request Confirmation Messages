Q2: You are required to write a query to find the IDs of users who requested a confirmation message twice within a 24-hour window. This is crucial for implementing measures to improve the security protocols.
Note:
Two messages exactly 24 hours apart are considered to be within the window.
The action does not affect the answer, only the request time.
The result table should be ordered by user_id in an ascending manner.

Ans:

SELECT DISTINCT user_id
FROM (
    SELECT 
        C.user_id, 
        TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, 
            LAG(C.time_stamp) OVER(PARTITION BY C.user_id ORDER BY C.time_stamp ASC), 
            C.time_stamp) AS difference
    FROM 
        confirmations AS C
) AS A
WHERE 
    A.difference <= 86400
ORDER BY 
    user_id ASC;
