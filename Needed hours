Q1: The task is to write a query to get the IDs of employees who did not meet the required monthly work hours.
The number of hours an employee worked can be calculated by summing up the number of minutes each employee worked in all of their sessions.
Also, round up the minutes for each session.
If the employee worked for 51 minutes and 2 seconds in a session, we consider it 52 minutes.
We can use CEIL() function to return the smallest integer value that is bigger than or equal to a number.
The result should be ordered by by employee_id in ascending order
Ans:
SELECT 
    E.employee_id
FROM 
    employees E
LEFT JOIN 
    logs L ON E.employee_id = L.employee_id
GROUP BY 
    E.employee_id, E.needed_hours
HAVING 
    (SUM(CEIL(IFNULL(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, L.in_time, L.out_time), 0) / 60)) / 60) < E.needed_hours
ORDER BY 
    E.employee_id;
